# ü•ã MMA Fight Outcome Predictor ‚Äì EDA Portfolio

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) portion of my MMA Fight Outcome Predictor project. This repository dives deep into the underlying trends, patterns, and insights from professional UFC fight data to build an intuition around predicting fight winners.

---

## üìä Goal

Perform in-depth exploratory analysis on UFC fight statistics to:
- Understand the relationship between fighter stats and outcomes
- Identify which features are most predictive
- Clean and prepare the dataset for model training

---

## üß† Dataset

The data was sourced from [Kaggle's UFC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com) and includes:
- Fighter physical stats (height, reach, stance, age)
- Fight-level stats (significant strikes, takedowns, control time)
- Historical win/loss records
- Fight outcomes

---

## üîç Key Questions Explored

- Do physical attributes like height and reach significantly impact the outcome?
- Is a higher striking accuracy or takedown defense more predictive of winning?
- Are there dominant fighting styles or stances that correlate with success?
- How balanced are wins across weight classes?
